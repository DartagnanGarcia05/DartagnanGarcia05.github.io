        <p id="dino">What's popping guys? I'm just a very cringey high schooler who's interested in becoming a Paleoecologist. I can sing and act as well as sometimes dance. VAPA and science are things that I'm extremely interested in as well as godzilla movies, fighting games, reading, and writing.
