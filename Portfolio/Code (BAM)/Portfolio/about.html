        <h1 id="CrystalBack"> About me!</h1>
        <p id="star"> Hello everyone! I'm D'Artagnan Garcia and I'm a musical Theatre boy from Mt. Eden high School in Hayward, California. I'm straight from hayward and have lived there since kindergarden. Ever since elementary I've always been in a performing arts class. In Middle School I was in Choir and was a small part of Show Choir where we both sang and danced. In my freshmen year I got into Theatre Arts and learned how to step into someone else's shoes using my empathy and completely act on as them. In the play at my school that year I had 6 different individual roles I memorized and performed. Also at a young age I realized my love for Biology and paleontology. I was a strange kid and only read encyclopedias until 5th grade of different kinds of dinosaurs and animals. I loved hearing about how they had their own adaptations and how they survived in their own unique and amazing ways. This sence of wonderous mystery led me into wanting to become a Paleontologist for much of my life. This was until 6th grade where my awesome teacher took us on a field trip to the Hayward shoreline. This is when he showed us the importance of ecology and I absolutely loved it. This led me to want to become a Paleoecologist after an old teacher's words of advice came slipping into my ear.  </p>
